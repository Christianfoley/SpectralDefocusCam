# Spectral Defocuscam
*Authors: Christian Foley, Kristina Monakhova, Kyrollos Yanny*

This software was developed in partnership with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley and the UCB/UCSF Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley.

The spectral_diffuser_defocus_tutorial_iterative notebook will take you through a previous work (Spectral DiffuserCam) and the iterative version of Spectral DefocusCam using the FISTA algorithm. 
<br> <br>
The spectral_defocus_tutorial_learning notebook will take you through the focus of this software (Spectral DefocusCam) and demonstrate how our reconstructive neural network is trained and applied.
